# GIF Ranking Automation Script

## Overview

This Python script automates the process of fetching and ranking GIFs based on a specific search term using the Giphy API. The script retrieves a set of GIFs, ranks them based on size, and outputs the URLs of the top-ranked GIFs.

## Features

- Fetches GIFs from Giphy based on a user-defined search term.
- Ranks the GIFs based on their size.
- Outputs the ranked list of GIF URLs.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x:** Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Giphy API Key:** Obtain an API key by signing up at the [Giphy Developers Portal](https://developers.giphy.com/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-gif-project.git
   cd my-gif-project
##Install Required Packages:

pip install requests

Configure the Script:

Open rank_gifs.py and replace YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY with your actual Giphy API key.

Usage
Run the Script:

Navigate to the project directory and execute the script:
python rank_gifs.py
Output:

The script will print the URLs of the ranked GIFs in your terminal.

Ranked GIFs
Here are the top-ranked GIFs based on the search term used:

GIF 1
GIF 2
GIF 3
GIF 4
GIF 5
GIF 6
GIF 7
GIF 8
GIF 9
GIF 10


How It Works
Fetching GIFs
The fetch_gifs(query) function sends a request to the Giphy API to retrieve GIFs based on the provided search term.
def fetch_gifs(query):
    response = requests.get(BASE_URL, params={
        'api_key': API_KEY,
        'q': query,
        'limit': 10,
        'offset': 0,
        'rating': 'g',
        'lang': 'en'
    })
    return response.json().get('data', [])
Ranking GIFs
The rank_gifs(gifs) function ranks the GIFs based on the size of their downsized image.

def rank_gifs(gifs):
    return sorted(gifs, key=lambda x: x.get('images', {}).get('downsized', {}).get('size', 0), reverse=True)


Main Execution
The main() function orchestrates the process by fetching GIFs, ranking them, and printing the results.


def main():
    query = 'funny'  # Replace with your search term
    gifs = fetch_gifs(query)
    ranked_gifs = rank_gifs(gifs)

    print('Ranked GIFs:')
    for gif in ranked_gifs:
        print(gif.get('url'))

Ranking Criteria
Size-Based Ranking: GIFs are ranked based on the size of their downsized image, assuming that a larger file size might correlate with popularity.

Future Enhancements
Enhanced Ranking Criteria: Incorporate additional data points such as trending status or user interaction metrics to improve ranking accuracy.
Web Interface: Create a simple web interface for easier interaction with the script.
Automation

Troubleshooting
API Key Errors: Ensure that your API key is correctly set in the script.
Connection Issues: Check your internet connection and verify that the Giphy API is accessible.
